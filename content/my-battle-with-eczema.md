When I was young, I had an array of skin issues that no 8-year old should have to deal with. I had eczema and remember being so dependent on a variety of creams to help me feel better and get through the day. I have vague memories of my lips being dry and bleeding while at school and frantically licking them to deal with it, not realizing that this was only making matters worse. It was so long ago that I don't really remember all the details but I _know_ that I have had skin problems from a young age.

This all changed when I moved to Canada. Seemingly overnight, all those problems has disappeared and I had no idea why. Frankly, I didn't really care to understand why - being a teenager, I was just happy to feel good about myself (as much as one can at that age) and have "control" over my body again felt great. My mother diagnosed the change in climate as the reason for this drastic improvement since Mauritius is very tropical and Canada is not. All that to say that things changed quickly and I did not dig deeper into it.

Lo and behold, during my 25th year of existence, a massive rash breaks out on both my arms and my eyes turn red and very itchy. In the same way that it disappeared when I was 15 years old, seemingly overnight , the eczema and skin issues that I thought I had put behind me when I moved to Canada came back with a vengeance. 

I really did not understand why it came back - my first thought was that I was working a stressful job under sub-optimal conditions. I worked in a cubicle in an office with no fresh air and even less sunlight. Being young, I was going out with my friends quite often and used caffeine as a means to balance a lifestyle where I was not prioritizing sleep. I was pushing myself, both physically and mentally, and thought that this was my body's way of telling me to pump the brakes. 

I knew that things needed to change and I was already planning to quit my job and backpack for an indefinite amount of time (you can read more about that [here](./my-backpacking-adventure-part-i.html)). So I went to the doctor to address my skin breakout and they prescribed me some steroid cream that I applied for a couple of weeks and everything went away. A few weeks later, I left for my trip and that was that. My skin was acting up while travelling but I attributed that to the stress of being alone in foreign places. 

It is only when I returned from my travels a year or so later that things really took a turn for the worse. My skin starting to deteriorate slowly but surely over the course of a few months. First, the rashes appeared at my "creases", that is behind my knees and at my elbows, but they soon spread to my entire body.

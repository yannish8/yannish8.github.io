    <h1>About</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="So Schmexy" src="/images/yannish-india-holi.jpeg"></p>
<p>My name is Yannish. I was born on a small island off the coast of Madagascar called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/h5rui7YoU5qwYoe46">Mauritius</a>. 
I grew up there and moved to Toronto, Canada when I was 14 years old. I studied Environment and Business at the 
University of Waterloo but had a hard time finding employment in that field once I graduated. Purely by accident, I fell 
into a data role at a large corporation and never looked back. <br></p>
<p>Now, I run the Data Team at <a href="https://www.watrhub.com">WatrHub Inc.</a>, a small Toronto-based startup focused on the 
water industry. I love my job and feel very lucky that I do. When I'm not working I enjoy playing my guitar, riding my 
bike around the city and playing and watching lots and lots of soccer. <br></p>
<p>This is a resume, portfolio, travel blog and everything in between. It originally started out as a way for me to learn
simple web development and finally document, in one place, all the things that I cared to share with the world, although I
imagine most people will not find it very interesting!</p>

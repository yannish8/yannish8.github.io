This year, prior to the COVID-19 quarantine, I took some time off of work and travelled to India. I had travelled to India once before in 2015 when I spent 5 months there as part of a year long backpacking trip but this was a different kind of adventure.

This time around, I took 3 weeks off of work mainly because I had some friends getting married in India and I thought it would be a great excuse to do some travelling! So my girlfriend, Suzanne, and I made an itinerary that took us from Chennai to Sikkim through Kolkata and finally to the Andaman Islands for a bit of relaxation before returning to frigid ol' Toronto. This is a blog/tale about that adventure!

We first flew to Chennai for the wedding. The celebrations were happening over 4 days which meant that there was little time to explore Chennai. However, there was not much to complain about as our days were filled with food, laughter, booze and a lot of cultural exchange! We took part in many  traditional ceremonies and I really feel like we experienced a true Indian wedding though some parts of it were definitely more "modern".

The wedding was both wonderful and chaotic. Witnessing all the traditions of Indian culture that I am so familiar with was comforting and quite enjoyable. Suz and I met a nice group of foreigners at the hotel and we all had a really nice time together.

It was also nice spending time with my friends (two of them travelled there as well)! Overall, the wedding was a very different kind of Indian experience from what I’m use to. We had a bus that shuttled everyone to each venue and back to the hotel everyday and most days were pack full of wedding activities. Suz and I had a nice time there although she was ill one day and missed the wedding! It was nice having her at the wedding and I feel like it made my experience better overall.

Once the wedding ended, we flew to Kolkata from Chennai and that is where the real backpacking adventure started and it did not start off smoothly. I accidentally left a restricted item in my checked baggage and it did not arrive in Kolkata. Since we had an overnight train that evening, I arranged to pickup the bag somewhere near our final destination.

I also had a really upset stomach on Friday evening ahead of the train departure and even contracted a fever during the night of the train ride.

Needless to say, Saturday morning was not particularly pleasant. Between my illness, no backpack and beginning the stressful endeavour of trying to retrieve said bag, there was a lot on my mind and I was not ready to deal with it all. I brushed my teeth and cleaned myself up a bit and felt more ready to take on the day. We went to Bagdogra airport and sat at the entrance for 2 hours patiently waiting for the plane to land and once it did, I was able to get my bag back! We then took a shared taxi to our Airbnb near Darjeeling which was also not a pleasant experience. We were scammed by someone at the airport who charged us 4 times the normal rate. The ride was cramped and uncomfortable and the winding mountain roads did not help. Finally, we arrived at our Airbnb which we were both very excited about. The experience there was quite nice although not exactly what I was expecting. The place is called TIEEDI, which stands for “Take it easy, easy does it.”, a saying in Nepal. It is nature-focused place where they practice permaculture, grow their own food and have built environmentally-friendly accomodation for guests. The staff was extremely kind and we met a couple from England who were riding a motorbike from Myanmar all the way back to the UK. We did a tour of a nearby village where we had some traditional Nepalese wine, went on a nice hike and ate some delicious and simple local food.

On Monday morning, we went to Darjeeling for a quick pit stop before moving on to Gangtok. We walked around the town for a little while, booked a shared taxi and went for a coffee in a nice little bakery with a beautiful view of the surroundings.

We then began a rather uncomfortable 4 hour journey in a cramped shared van with 10 people in it. Swerving left and right more often than one would like, we inched along mountains roads with a few pit stops along the way. It definitely felt like we were fully immersed in Indian culture during that time!

The ride to Gangtok was quite incredible and nothing like I had experienced before. The scenery and the city itself were so beautiful.

We spent a couple of nights in Gangtok although we arrived later in the afternoon and left quite early on our third day which meant that we only had one full day to explore the city and we definitely took advantage of it! We were out and about in the morning and went to a Buddhist temple as well as the Institute of Tibetology which were both fascinating. Though I had been to Buddhist temples before and was familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, it was interesting to have a more authentic perspective, given that we were so close to Tibet.

By midday, we had visited both places and were deciding on another place to explore in the afternoon. It was a cold and rainy day but we were determined to make the most of it. I came across the Himalayan Zoological Park which was located just 20 minutes outside the city. Tickets were rather cheap and we could walk around the entire place freely and stop by animal enclosures as we saw fit. The experience did not disappoint! Even with the weather being rather crappy, we walked around the entire park for roughly 2 hours and saw a variety of fauna including a leopard, a yak and many more! It was also really nice walking in the forested area and felt like a hike. Even though we were wet and cold by the end of the day, the experience was really worth it.

With our adventure in Gangtok complete and being more familiar with the Indian transportation system, we booked a more comfortable ride back to Bagdogra Airport where we had an evening flight to take us back to Kolkata. It was a 5 hour ride that was rather uneventful which was very much appreciated! We did drive along the river for some time and that was quite picturesque.

We landed in Kolkata in the late evening on Wednesday and got to our hostel fairly late. It was a hectic evening since we had to leave very early the next day for a one-night two-day tour of Sundarbans National Park. We packed a smaller bag for the next day and then went to sleep. The next morning we were up bright and early and joined a group of tourists to embark on our Indian safari. I had low expectations for this particular excursion given our experience at the eco-village near Darjeeling but this was not the same!

We met a couple from the UK that we got on with pretty well and there were also some missionaries from the LDS church that were on a mini-holiday in Kolkata. We took a bus and a boat ride that totalled 5 hours before reaching the eco-village. It was great to experience a different part of India that was more focused on its fauna and flora.

The eco-village itself was amazing and much more comfortable - it all had been built in the last 2 years and given the size of the village and everything available within, it seemed like an amazing feat!

We went on a tour of the village and Sonu, our guide, explained the traditions, customs and lifestyle of the locals. We also went on a boat ride and explored the mangrove - Sundarbans is actually the largest mangrove forest in the world! That evening we ate a delicious dinner and went on our third boat ride of the day, this time at night, to see the stars and luminescent planktons in the water. Our boat driver also sang a beautiful song during the evening which was a rather odd yet enchanting experience!

The next morning, we were up bright and early to get our permits to enter the jungle and hopefully see some fauna and the experience did not disappoint! We saw some common and rare kingfishers, crocodiles, moniker lizards, eagles and a variety of other birds but we were all there hoping to see the Bengal tiger, which was a rather rare occurrence given its solitary nature.

We went to one watchtower hoping to see one but to no avail and then moved on to the second and final one hoping that our luck would be better there. We spent 45 mins perched and on the lookout and resolved that we were not going to be so lucky. We all went back to the boat and were ready to depart when we saw a group of people running over back to the watchtower - they had heard the tiger and thought that it would be coming to the watering hole at any moment. The next few minutes were filled with anguish as we all silently waited to see whether or not we would get to experience this rare sighting. We finally saw not one but two tigers and it was an amazing experience! One came to the watering hole, walked around for a while and I really feel like we got to see it in all its glory.

After our adventure in Sundarbans, we started the journey to the Andaman Islands where we would end our trip in relaxing fashion before going back to cold, cold, cold Canada. The journey itself was hectic, as usual. While the flight to Port Blair from Kolkata was quite smooth, we were swarmed by taxi drivers as soon as we exited the airport. We landed on a Saturday which meant that there was little chance of us getting tickets to the local ferry heading to Havelock. We tried in vain to call the multiple private ferry companies that were advertising in the airport but no one picked up. We also were worried about the amount of cash we had on hand since multiple people had mentioned that it was rather difficult to withdraw money on Havelock island. We reluctantly hired a rather aggressive taxi driver who took us to the private ferry to get our tickets and then to multiple ATMs where we were unable to withdraw any money. With the ferry time getting closer, we decided to head to the jetty and sort out our financial situation once we were on the island.

While making our way to Havelock was hectic, navigating on the island itself was quite easy. Since it is so small, there aren’t a lot of scams or people trying to sell you everything under the sun. We found a cheap tuktuk relatively quickly and were able to withdraw cash at an ATM before checking into our hotel. I was relieved by that because I thought that money might have otherwise been tight. The resort we were staying at was a welcomed sight and much nicer than I was anticipating!

The next few days were filled with sun bathing, swimming in the ocean, eating delicious sea food and riding around scooter around town discovering the various things Havelock has to offer. The food was amazing and the restaurant in our resort had the best combination of atmosphere, food and distance that we could hope for so we spent a few evenings relaxing there. Havelock is a small island and riding our scooters to the various beaches and tourist points was an ideal way to explore all it had to offer.

There was also a rather unfortunate incident where I was stung by a sting ray while snorkelling on one of the beaches. The pain was excruciating and I was evacuated to the nearest hospital where I was given a painkiller and had to wait it out. The locals were very helpful and there must have been 15 people around me on the beach trying to diagnose the cause of my injury. It was a deeply unpleasant experience that should make for a good story but I’m not sure if that will be worth the pain caused.

Our time in Havelock was nice and a welcomed break from the hectic travelling of the previous week and our busy (and cold) lives back in Canada.

We took the ferry from Havelock to Port Blair and then flew from Port Blair straight to Chennai and spent an evening exploring the city before catching out flight back to Toronto. Overall, it was a great trip that I would recommend to anyone looking to explore the less travelled parts of India!

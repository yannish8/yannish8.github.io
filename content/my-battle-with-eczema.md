I recently went through a difficult experience with eczema that I thought I would share. During that time, I read a lot of articles and blogs from people going through something similar and found it helpful - it made me realize that eczema (and other skin conditions) are very difficult to diagnose. I found that people have attempted many things with a varying degree of success - perhaps this story about how I was able to heal my eczema will help you! (At least, that is my hope)

When I was young, I had an array of skin issues that no 8-year old should have to deal with. I had eczema and remember being so dependent on a variety of creams to help me feel better and get through the day. I have vague memories of my lips being dry and bleeding while at school and frantically licking them to deal with it, not realizing that this was only making matters worse. It was so long ago that I don't really remember all the details but I _know_ that I have had skin problems from a young age.

This all changed when I moved to Canada. Seemingly overnight, all those problems has disappeared and I had no idea why. Frankly, I didn't really care to understand why - being a teenager, I was just happy to feel good about myself (as much as one can at that age) and have "control" over my body again felt great. My mother diagnosed the change in climate as the reason for this drastic improvement since Mauritius is very tropical and Canada is not. All that to say that things changed quickly and I did not dig deeper into it.

Lo and behold, during my 25th year of existence, a massive rash breaks out on both my arms and my eyes turn red and very itchy. In the same way that it disappeared when I was 15 years old, seemingly overnight , the eczema and skin issues that I thought I had put behind me when I moved to Canada came back with a vengeance. 

I really did not understand why it came back - my first thought was that I was working a stressful job under sub-optimal conditions. I worked in a cubicle in an office with no fresh air and even less sunlight. Being young, I was going out with my friends quite often and used caffeine as a means to balance a lifestyle where I was not prioritizing sleep. I was pushing myself, both physically and mentally, and thought that this was my body's way of telling me to pump the brakes. 

I knew that things needed to change and I was already planning to quit my job and backpack for an indefinite amount of time (you can read more about that [here](./my-backpacking-adventure-part-i.html)). So I went to the doctor to address my skin breakout and they prescribed me some steroid cream that I applied for a couple of weeks and everything went away. A few weeks later, I left for my trip and that was that. My skin was acting up while travelling but I attributed that to the stress of being alone in foreign places. 

It is only when I returned from my travels a year or so later that things really took a turn for the worse. My skin starting to deteriorate slowly but surely over the course of a few months. First, the rashes appeared at my "creases", that is behind my knees and at my elbows, but they soon spread to my entire body. I really wasn't sure what was happening and tried everything, from a naturopath path to oat baths and steroid creams, but nothing seemed to be helping.

I grew increasingly desperate as things were getting worse - the rash and itchiness was manageable during the day as I had many distractions but it was awful during the night. I cannot remember the amount of times I woke up in the middle of the night itching myself and not being able to sleep. I think that I spent the better part of a year sleeping between 3 and 4 hours a night.

This is when I knew I had to do something - while the itching was awful, the inability to sleep properly put me in a state of mind that I had never been in. I had found myself constantly feeling groggy, anxious, stressed, irritated (among other emotions) and I now realize that it was all attributed to my lack of sleep which itself was attributed to my skin issues. 

The turning point was when I booked an appointment with the dermatologist. I was looking forward to it as I had read about others who were able to overcome their challenges with the help of a dedicated skin specialist. This is not how things went. Let me paint a picture for ya: I am eagerly waiting in his office and am running through all the things I can discuss with him. I was committed to making drastic changes for this to go away. After waiting for some time, he bashes through the door and barely has time to acknowledge my presence. This is a short summary of our discussion:

> "So, what's wrong with ya?" 
>
> "Well, I'm having some issues with my skin" (I show him)
>
> "Well, that's eczema" 
>
> "It's getting pretty bad - I'm thinking of doing an elimination diet"
>
> "You can do a diet for 10 years and never figure it out"
>
> "OK...what are my options then?"
>
> "Well, there's this new drug that isn't yet approved by the Canadian government. It cost about $15,000 and you will have to receive injections monthly. Oh and one of the possible side effects is pink eye. Here is a pamphlet about it."
>
> "OK I'll look into it"
>
> "See ya"

I left the office that day feeling so dejected. I had a lot of hopes for that appointment and was so disappointed by this doctor's lack of care and empathy.

Eventually, I decided to take matters in my own hands. I decided to do a month long elimination diet where I would be eating nothing but chicken, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, bananas, almonds, pumpkin seeds, salt, pepper. It sounds like a lot of food but if you ever pay attention to your diet (or try this elimination diet), you will quickly realize that it isn't. ***This is all I ate for an entire month.***

And you know what? It worked. 10 years, my ass. It took 1 month for me to figure it out. And the one think that I want you to take away from this (if you have made it this far), is that you have to stick with it. For the first 2 weeks, I saw no improvement in my skin - I was constantly itchy and really felt like giving up - but I had told myself that I would do it for a month and was committed to that timeline, and I am extremely happy that I stuck with it.

This diet was done almost two years ago and I've been mostly eczema free for about a year now. I slowly started to re-introduce foods, one week at a time, and thought I had pin-pointed eggs and dairy as the culprit. I cut that out of my diet for nearly a year but that turned out to not be it. I'm now leaning towards oats and my skin has been amazing since I cut that out - if this turns out to be the actual cause of all of this, those oat baths that I thought were helping all this time ago were doing very much the opposite...

Well, that's about it - I hope that if you are reading this and going through something similar, my story helps you realize that you are not alone and there is, potentially, a way to get out of this. This may not be the right solution for you though - when I was going through this experience and spending time online researching, I realized that there is a million different causes for this. I was lucky enough to figure mine out but ultimately, being dedicated, determined and trying to see it through is what helped me the most.

                <p>This year, prior to the COVID-19 quarantine, I took some time off of work and travelled to India. I had travelled to India once before in 2015 when I spent 5 months there as part of a year long backpacking trip. I  looked very different back then but things have since changed!</p>
<p>This time around, I took 3 weeks off of work primarily because I had some friends getting married in India and I thought it would be a great excuse to do some travelling! So my girlfriend, Suzanne, and I made an itinerary that took us from Chennai to Sikkim through Kolkata and finally to the Andaman Islands for a bit of relaxation before returning to frigid ol' Toronto. This is a blog/tale about that adventure!</p>
<p>We first flew to Chennai for the wedding. The celebrations were happening over 4 days which meant that there was little time to explore Chennai! However, there was not much to complain about as our days were filled with food, laughter, booze and a lot of cultural exchange! We took part in a lot of traditional ceremonies and I really feel like we experienced a true Indian wedding though some parts of it were definitely more "modern".</p>

<p>The wedding was both wonderful and chaotic. Witnessing all the traditions of Indian culture that I am so familiar with was comforting and quite enjoyable. Suz and I met a nice group of foreigners at the hotel and we all had a really nice time together.</p>
<p>It was also nice spending time with my friends (two of them travelled there as well)! Overall, the wedding was a very different kind of Indian experience from what I’m use to. We had a bus that shuttled everyone to each venue and back to the hotel everyday and most days were pack full of wedding activities. Suz and I had a nice time there although she was ill one day and missed the wedding! It was nice having her at the wedding and I feel like it made my experience better overall.</p>

<p>Once the wedding ended, we flew to Kolkata from Chennai and that is where the real backpacking adventure started and it did not start off smoothly. I accidentally left a restricted item in my checked baggage and it did not arrive in Kolkata. Since we had an overnight train that evening, I arranged to pickup the bag somewhere near our final destination.</p>
<p><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JcwRf60bn_Z-7ElvSwh4Ex-PFmiQArohUIj7ieoJyMO9fHhvblRMCVLsDK_U1dP0GhKyZ0zbBscU5ncPIWALaTtOwjZkB7LvaCVA5Lr2LuIGxUuTNZcCTkA8TYgr3UApQFwsoYzcLWw' /></a></p>
<p>I also had a really upset stomach on Friday evening ahead of the train departure and even contracted a fever during the night of the train ride.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Saturday morning was not particularly pleasant. Between my illness, no backpack and beginning the stressful endeavour of trying to retrieve said bag, there was a lot on my mind and I was not ready to deal with it all. I brushed my teeth and cleaned myself up a bit and felt more ready to take on the day. We went to Bagdogra airport and sat at the entrance for 2 hours patiently waiting for the plane to land and once it did, I was able to get my bag back! We then took a shared taxi to our Airbnb near Darjeeling which was also not a pleasant experience. We were scammed by someone at the airport who charged us 4 times the normal rate. The ride was cramped and uncomfortable and the winding mountain roads did not help. Finally, we arrived at our Airbnb which we were both very excited about. The experience there was quite nice although not exactly what I was expecting. The place is called TIEEDI, which stands for “Take it easy, easy does it.”, a saying in Nepal. It is nature-focused place where they practice permaculture, grow their own foods and have built environmentally-friendly accomodation for guests. The staff was extremely kind and we met a couple from England who were riding a motorbike from Myanmar all the way back to the UK. We did a tour of a nearby village where we had some traditional Nepalese wine, went on a nice hike and ate some delicious and simple local food. </p>

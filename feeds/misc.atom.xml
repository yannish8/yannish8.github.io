During that time, I read a lot of articles and blogs from people going through something similar and found it helpful - it made me realize that eczema (and other skin conditions) are very difficult to diagnose. I found that people have attempted many things with a varying degree of success - perhaps this story about how I was able to heal my eczema will help you! (At least, that is my hope)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I had an array of skin issues that no 8-year old should have to deal with. I had eczema and remember being so dependent on a variety of creams to help me feel better and get through the day. I have vague memories of my lips being dry and bleeding while at school and frantically licking them to deal with it, not realizing that this was only making matters worse. It was so long ago that I don't really remember all the details but I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that I have had skin problems from a young age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all changed when I moved to Canada. Seemingly overnight, all those problems has disappeared and I had no idea why. Frankly, I didn't really care to understand why - being a teenager, I was just happy to feel good about myself (as much as one can at that age) and have "control" over my body again felt great. My mother diagnosed the change in climate as the reason for this drastic improvement since Mauritius is very tropical and Canada is not. All that to say that things changed quickly and I did not dig deeper into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, during my 25th year of existence, a massive rash breaks out on both my arms and my eyes turn red and very itchy. In the same way that it disappeared when I was 15 years old, seemingly overnight , the eczema and skin issues that I thought I had put behind me when I moved to Canada came back with a vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really did not understand why it came back - my first thought was that I was working a stressful job under sub-optimal conditions. I worked in a cubicle in an office with no fresh air and even less sunlight. Being young, I was going out with my friends quite often and used caffeine as a means to balance a lifestyle where I was not prioritizing sleep. I was pushing myself, both physically and mentally, and thought that this was my body's way of telling me to pump the brakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that things needed to change and I was already planning to quit my job and backpack for an indefinite amount of time (you can read more about that &lt;a href="./my-backpacking-adventure-part-i.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). So I went to the doctor to address my skin breakout and they prescribed me some steroid cream that I applied for a couple of weeks and everything went away. A few weeks later, I left for my trip and that was that. My skin was acting up while travelling but I attributed that to the stress of being alone in foreign places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only when I returned from my travels a year or so later that things really took a turn for the worse. My skin starting to deteriorate slowly but surely over the course of a few months. First, the rashes appeared at my "creases", that is behind my knees and at my elbows, but they soon spread to my entire body. I really wasn't sure what was happening and tried everything, from a naturopath path to oat baths and steroid creams, but nothing seemed to be helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew increasingly desperate as things were getting worse - the rash and itchiness was manageable during the day as I had many distractions but it was awful during the night. I cannot remember the amount of times I woke up in the middle of the night itching myself and not being able to sleep. I think that I spent the better part of a year sleeping between 3 and 4 hours a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I knew I had to do something - while the itching was awful, the inability to sleep properly put me in a state of mind that I had never been in. I had found myself constantly feeling groggy, anxious, stressed, irritated (among other emotions) and I now realize that it was all attributed to my lack of sleep which itself was attributed to my skin issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turning point was when I booked an appointment with the dermatologist. I was looking forward to it as I had read about others who were able to overcome their challenges with the help of a dedicated skin specialist. This is not how things went. Let me paint a picture for ya: I am eagerly waiting in his office and am running through all the things I can discuss with him. I was committed to making drastic changes for this to go away. After waiting for some time, he bashes through the door and barely has time to acknowledge my presence. This is a short summary of our discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, what's wrong with ya?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, I'm having some issues with my skin" (I show him)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, that's eczema" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's getting pretty bad - I'm thinking of doing an elimination diet"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You can do a diet for 10 years and never figure it out"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OK...what are my options then?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, there's this new drug that isn't yet approved by the Canadian government. It cost about $15,000 and you will have to receive injections monthly. Oh and one of the possible side effects is pink eye. Here is a pamphlet about it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OK I'll look into it"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"See ya"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the office that day feeling so dejected. I had a lot of hopes for that appointment and was so disappointed by this doctor's lack of care and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided to take matters in my own hands. I decided to do a month long elimination diet where I would be eating nothing but chicken, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, bananas, almonds, pumpkin seeds, salt, pepper. It sounds like a lot of food but if you ever pay attention to your diet (or try this elimination diet), you will quickly realize that it isn't. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is all I ate for an entire month.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? It worked. 10 years, my ass. It took 1 month for me to figure it out. And the one think that I want you to take away from this (if you have made it this far), is that you have to stick with it. For the first 2 weeks, I saw no improvement in my skin - I was constantly itchy and really felt like giving up - but I had told myself that I would do it for a month and was committed to that timeline, and I am extremely happy that I stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diet was done almost two years ago and I've been mostly eczema free for about a year now. I slowly started to re-introduce foods, one week at a time, and thought I had pin-pointed eggs and dairy as the culprit. I cut that out of my diet for nearly a year but that turned out to not be it. I'm now leaning towards oats and my skin has been amazing since I cut that out - if this turns out to be the actual cause of all of this, those oat baths that I thought were helping all this time ago were doing very much the opposite...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that's about it - I hope that if you are reading this and going through something similar, my story helps you realize that you are not alone and there is, potentially, a way to get out of this. This may not be the right solution for you though - when I was going through this experience and spending time online researching, I realized that there is a million different causes for this. I was lucky enough to figure mine out but ultimately, being dedicated, determined and trying to see it through is what helped me the most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="health"></category><category term="diet"></category></entry><entry><title>A Simple Analysis of NBA 3 Point Shooters</title><link href="/a-simple-analysis-of-nba-3-point-shooters.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Yannish</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-06-09:/a-simple-analysis-of-nba-3-point-shooters.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a big basketball fan and was always fascinated by the data that was generated for players, teams, seasons, etc. A friend and I thought it would be interesting to analyze 3-point data to see who had the largest single season increase (and decrease) in 3-point percentage. &lt;/p&gt;

I had travelled to India once before in 2015 when I spent 5 months there as part of a year long backpacking trip but this was a different kind of adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around, I took 3 weeks off of work mainly because I had some friends getting married in India and I thought it would be a great excuse to do some travelling! So my girlfriend, Suzanne, and I made an itinerary that took us from Chennai to Sikkim through Kolkata and finally to the Andaman Islands for a bit of relaxation before returning to frigid ol' Toronto. This is a blog/tale about that adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first flew to Chennai for the wedding. The celebrations were happening over 4 days which meant that there was little time to explore Chennai. However, there was not much to complain about as our days were filled with food, laughter, booze and a lot of cultural exchange! We took part in many  traditional ceremonies and I really feel like we experienced a true Indian wedding though some parts of it were definitely more "modern".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gGxAKS0SHfVL1st_qHuD_PTHmE2sWELWkJ8v0dL1RnszdSUsJWEBW1kVaeaHDFpCjLLSuQJ0ZhU8OCQdMSrvm_VOn0iF9kbl5LLDr6sEcbTtkKGHimt_jOlYpm8ti-o1EEqT3h4fAvM'/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wedding was both wonderful and chaotic. Witnessing all the traditions of Indian culture that I am so familiar with was comforting and quite enjoyable. Suz and I met a nice group of foreigners at the hotel and we all had a really nice time together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also nice spending time with my friends (two of them travelled there as well)! Overall, the wedding was a very different kind of Indian experience from what I’m use to. We had a bus that shuttled everyone to each venue and back to the hotel everyday and most days were pack full of wedding activities. Suz and I had a nice time there although she was ill one day and missed the wedding! It was nice having her at the wedding and I feel like it made my experience better overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6JxIxFgaPL76eGv73hBV2toC0erWLpM06o07QZvllxzn_mHcFmbh2fydukqxRK7kH1SU8TOOg_NW_6z2QAWz8_3nzxAj0J_YB_Ib9UHfIJPZNoa_CT_v2PRKhWpxG16xd2SOxBlAPf4'/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the wedding ended, we flew to Kolkata from Chennai and that is where the real backpacking adventure started and it did not start off smoothly. I accidentally left a restricted item in my checked baggage and it did not arrive in Kolkata. Since we had an overnight train that evening, I arranged to pickup the bag somewhere near our final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JcwRf60bn_Z-7ElvSwh4Ex-PFmiQArohUIj7ieoJyMO9fHhvblRMCVLsDK_U1dP0GhKyZ0zbBscU5ncPIWALaTtOwjZkB7LvaCVA5Lr2LuIGxUuTNZcCTkA8TYgr3UApQFwsoYzcLWw' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a really upset stomach on Friday evening ahead of the train departure and even contracted a fever during the night of the train ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Saturday morning was not particularly pleasant. Between my illness, no backpack and beginning the stressful endeavour of trying to retrieve said bag, there was a lot on my mind and I was not ready to deal with it all. I brushed my teeth and cleaned myself up a bit and felt more ready to take on the day. We went to Bagdogra airport and sat at the entrance for 2 hours patiently waiting for the plane to land and once it did, I was able to get my bag back! We then took a shared taxi to our Airbnb near Darjeeling which was also not a pleasant experience. We were scammed by someone at the airport who charged us 4 times the normal rate. The ride was cramped and uncomfortable and the winding mountain roads did not help. Finally, we arrived at our Airbnb which we were both very excited about. The experience there was quite nice although not exactly what I was expecting. The place is called TIEEDI, which stands for “Take it easy, easy does it.”, a saying in Nepal. It is nature-focused place where they practice permaculture, grow their own food and have built environmentally-friendly accomodation for guests. The staff was extremely kind and we met a couple from England who were riding a motorbike from Myanmar all the way back to the UK. We did a tour of a nearby village where we had some traditional Nepalese wine, went on a nice hike and ate some delicious and simple local food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4YuvxPy2-Oo7XQvLIH2H2ZK7-Jsu5rCnPq_6Dd7dNvxtznnZDUlf4ZfvQUD8KCtcOqber6xZJq3QUnai54KgT8vkHsYPdY7pfO-KdJBHz0Sv7LQgcMsp-1fcYSAI6J3PPnr3_OK888Y' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, we went to Darjeeling for a quick pit stop before moving on to Gangtok. We walked around the town for a little while, booked a shared taxi and went for a coffee in a nice little bakery with a beautiful view of the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then began a rather uncomfortable 4 hour journey in a cramped shared van with 10 people in it. Swerving left and right more often than one would like, we inched along mountains roads with a few pit stops along the way. It definitely felt like we were fully immersed in Indian culture during that time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hGxgCXp7uNkesXVofBqpeFBJnYuV-SswxVh6jcZ7ow9TIp8_rQXkQIbZVdd5SNvIjHbUFpeez6zn4T-l-oJcPdsvPiyj7HIawO3zmrdawmFK0X5vohVRiIoEy59j2-_GvrdYUNx32SU"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride to Gangtok was quite incredible and nothing like I had experienced before. The scenery and the city itself were so beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xSv2MMhYTmmWy96otHf0Yygm08kzdGIkzwGKS8xDnOwt2a0fsc1vIDxbgODvvCIXMoGRKezG_09YRA06j3D17KTp1rzSnOLhtM0Ux9Zj3ItldkH6I5tms8b2zpS0Kl3iQLakiQkblGM" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of nights in Gangtok although we arrived later in the afternoon and left quite early on our third day which meant that we only had one full day to explore the city and we definitely took advantage of it! We were out and about in the morning and went to a Buddhist temple as well as the Institute of Tibetology which were both fascinating. Though I had been to Buddhist temples before and was familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, it was interesting to have a more authentic perspective, given that we were so close to Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By midday, we had visited both places and were deciding on another place to explore in the afternoon. It was a cold and rainy day but we were determined to make the most of it. I came across the Himalayan Zoological Park which was located just 20 minutes outside the city. Tickets were rather cheap and we could walk around the entire place freely and stop by animal enclosures as we saw fit. The experience did not disappoint! Even with the weather being rather crappy, we walked around the entire park for roughly 2 hours and saw a variety of fauna including a leopard, a yak and many more! It was also really nice walking in the forested area and felt like a hike. Even though we were wet and cold by the end of the day, the experience was really worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our adventure in Gangtok complete and being more familiar with the Indian transportation system, we booked a more comfortable ride back to Bagdogra Airport where we had an evening flight to take us back to Kolkata. It was a 5 hour ride that was rather uneventful which was very much appreciated! We did drive along the river for some time and that was quite picturesque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed in Kolkata in the late evening on Wednesday and got to our hostel fairly late. It was a hectic evening since we had to leave very early the next day for a one-night two-day tour of Sundarbans National Park. We packed a smaller bag for the next day and then went to sleep. The next morning we were up bright and early and joined a group of tourists to embark on our Indian safari. I had low expectations for this particular excursion given our experience at the eco-village near Darjeeling but this was not the same!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met a couple from the UK that we got on with pretty well and there were also some missionaries from the LDS church that were on a mini-holiday in Kolkata. We took a bus and a boat ride that totalled 5 hours before reaching the eco-village. It was great to experience a different part of India that was more focused on its fauna and flora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eco-village itself was amazing and much more comfortable - it all had been built in the last 2 years and given the size of the village and everything available within, it seemed like an amazing feat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i_7dLCoxu0cZpN3mi1PDfQqrFF9QfBiZkxunKCCRniLw81M96lz56BgT7U0HyY0ibn4IvU4RHsYpspsz8yM-0EPXIrOuk90i6gsCQ25LhNU2maOGyI3rkbYIHlj-iVLQv_GYnHWxT50" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on a tour of the village and Sonu, our guide, explained the traditions, customs and lifestyle of the locals. We also went on a boat ride and explored the mangrove - Sundarbans is actually the largest mangrove forest in the world! That evening we ate a delicious dinner and went on our third boat ride of the day, this time at night, to see the stars and luminescent planktons in the water. Our boat driver also sang a beautiful song during the evening which was a rather odd yet enchanting experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mi8DV0mIPCI-NiS3Or3PWb9UHajSBWz675kHhAzG0AcDVzAwbVkh9hGD0p0s5wqLUNbOVjPGzHbVXUwYXJnNAtE0CWrF6cGVRADoJ1Sg4FVIQnHYR9opMFDLB_-lNvsfHwVDADnl_n0=w600-h315-p-k" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we were up bright and early to get our permits to enter the jungle and hopefully see some fauna and the experience did not disappoint! We saw some common and rare kingfishers, crocodiles, moniker lizards, eagles and a variety of other birds but we were all there hoping to see the Bengal tiger, which was a rather rare occurrence given its solitary nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to one watchtower hoping to see one but to no avail and then moved on to the second and final one hoping that our luck would be better there. We spent 45 mins perched and on the lookout and resolved that we were not going to be so lucky. We all went back to the boat and were ready to depart when we saw a group of people running over back to the watchtower - they had heard the tiger and thought that it would be coming to the watering hole at any moment. The next few minutes were filled with anguish as we all silently waited to see whether or not we would get to experience this rare sighting. We finally saw not one but two tigers and it was an amazing experience! One came to the watering hole, walked around for a while and I really feel like we got to see it in all its glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UpJO1zwAXSZsskV5NlR78jWyVtXTjWr4wbeHp_dg7CBHcLazTCx8C0SL3ZWoEyoyQC1C5Up-C1_BnF45s0yZ97h1RAY_Md4THhNzxfI9o7-yZZ3ifoZ1Z6p2beOBgrcX2ndeFqcnl2Y" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our adventure in Sundarbans, we started the journey to the Andaman Islands where we would end our trip in relaxing fashion before going back to cold, cold, cold Canada. The journey itself was hectic, as usual. While the flight to Port Blair from Kolkata was quite smooth, we were swarmed by taxi drivers as soon as we exited the airport. We landed on a Saturday which meant that there was little chance of us getting tickets to the local ferry heading to Havelock. We tried in vain to call the multiple private ferry companies that were advertising in the airport but no one picked up. We also were worried about the amount of cash we had on hand since multiple people had mentioned that it was rather difficult to withdraw money on Havelock island. We reluctantly hired a rather aggressive taxi driver who took us to the private ferry to get our tickets and then to multiple ATMs where we were unable to withdraw any money. With the ferry time getting closer, we decided to head to the jetty and sort out our financial situation once we were on the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While making our way to Havelock was hectic, navigating on the island itself was quite easy. Since it is so small, there aren’t a lot of scams or people trying to sell you everything under the sun. We found a cheap tuktuk relatively quickly and were able to withdraw cash at an ATM before checking into our hotel. I was relieved by that because I thought that money might have otherwise been tight. The resort we were staying at was a welcomed sight and much nicer than I was anticipating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xM1u8tXN9JpfrOAJNL0QLoRCJTWRfe-phPrlWr66AVoJlU5ZFrOC9dqCOQkcVige_gug47HZkIU-yteY2SBhH2N5GJ8lgF9FvQip40HLF4J665xlxPcCfx7Tzqf3xkiDKEURzt_i5kU" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days were filled with sun bathing, swimming in the ocean, eating delicious sea food and riding around scooter around town discovering the various things Havelock has to offer. The food was amazing and the restaurant in our resort had the best combination of atmosphere, food and distance that we could hope for so we spent a few evenings relaxing there. Havelock is a small island and riding our scooters to the various beaches and tourist points was an ideal way to explore all it had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a rather unfortunate incident where I was stung by a sting ray while snorkelling on one of the beaches. The pain was excruciating and I was evacuated to the nearest hospital where I was given a painkiller and had to wait it out. The locals were very helpful and there must have been 15 people around me on the beach trying to diagnose the cause of my injury. It was a deeply unpleasant experience that should make for a good story but I’m not sure if that will be worth the pain caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our time in Havelock was nice and a welcomed break from the hectic travelling of the previous week and our busy (and cold) lives back in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the ferry from Havelock to Port Blair and then flew from Port Blair straight to Chennai and spent an evening exploring the city before catching out flight back to Toronto. Overall, it was a great trip that I would recommend to anyone looking to explore the less travelled parts of India!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="India"></category></entry><entry><title>My Backpacking Adventure - Part I</title><link href="/my-backpacking-adventure-part-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Yannish</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-03-23:/my-backpacking-adventure-part-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was 25 years old, I decided to quit my job and embark on a year-long journey to Asia.

This is a "brief" write up about this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to write about a journey like this? I pondered this many times during my trip, forcing myself to sit down and write by hand all the experiences I had. I tried to do this many times on my adventure and it always felt like a chore. When my journal containing all these stories was stolen, along with many other and more valuable things (more on that later), I thought that the time will come to let these thoughts flow but that I should enjoy this trip and not worry about forgetting each moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this “journal” on the one year anniversary of my departure and I feel like I cannot remember all the things I have experienced and learnt and it scares me. I dove right back into daily life upon my return and it feels like a life time has passed since I decided to leave. So, here I am, willing and motivated to put on “paper” all the incredible things that happened on my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are wondering why I refer to "staying alive", it has to do with a song I listened to quite often before doing this trip. No, it's not Staying Alive by the Bee Gees (although I cannot blame you if that was your guess) but rather this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucJk8TxyRg"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last September, I quit my job and decided to travel, starting off in India and making my way by land (as much as possible) through Asia over the course of ten months. I spent 5 incredible months in India which I can easily say was the best time of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start from the beginning, shall we - I flew from Toronto to New Delhi on a gruelling flight that took me through Chicago and Helsinki over three days. In the spirit of this adventure, I had decided that when I landed, I would jump right in the metro and make my way to the hostel using directions from Google Maps that I had written in my journal. Terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got out of the airport, I was hit by what can only be described as an unbearable (in hindsight, this is an exaggeration but at the time, I did not think I would make it through it) stench, along with a smog so thick you can barely see across the road - there's really nothing like it. Easily enough, I find the entrance to the subway and hop right along to my destination: the New Delhi Railway Station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know, the railway station is located in the heart of the city and is one of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi_railway_station"&gt;largest and biggest in India&lt;/a&gt;. It is quite difficult to put into words the scene that I witnessed upon arrival but, in my humble opinion, it is what best describes India - something that you cannot believe at first, end up loathing after you have been in it for a while and miss sorely once you are no longer there. While I look like I belong in India (I am of Indian origins), my backpack gives me away as a tourist and I am quickly surrounded by rickshaws trying to get me to hire their service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Google, I should be able to walk from the railway station to my hostel but if you witness the clusterf*ck that I was in, you would understand that there was no way to get out of it unless you had been living there for some time. So I hire a rickshaw, pay about 5 times ($2 CAD…steep!) the normal price and get dropped off in a street that looks like the entrance to a dump site. There are no street signs or names and it is nearly impossible to tell where one street ends and another begins. Thankfully, I had remembered some of the instruction on the hostel website about their location and asked some locals who sent me in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking for about 5 minutes, I see a landmark mentioned on the website (a Citibank ATM) and think I must be close... However, their is a foul-smelling urinal located right at the entrance of the alley where I would be living for the next three days. I think  to myself "I must be in the wrong place" and walk on to look for another “more normal” street but to no avail. So I muster up whatever courage I have remaining, and walk, nose clenched, into this alley. Lo and behold, after a restaurant located right across from the urinal, a small convenience store and a sketchy looking hotel, I see my hostel! I could not believe I had made my way through all of that confusion to find my way there and this was my very first day in the country!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel I am in isn’t really suited to my travel style. It’s fairly cheap (about $20 a night) - however, when compared to all other accommodations I discovered during my trip, this price was outrageous! To be fair, I was afforded a private room with bathroom and AC but it was difficult to meet other travellers in this setting. I spent the next three days on a weird sleep schedule because of the jet lag but most importantly because I could not find it in me to venture outside in the unbearable heat in Paharganj (this room did have AC after all). For those that don't know, Paharganj is a famous neighbourhood of New Delhi where a lot of cheap hostels and hence, backpackers, are located. It is full of shops and restaurants and is too chaotic for someone that just spent 3 days flying from the other side of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had enough of this lonely experience and fully recovered from my jet lag, I pack up and move to another hostel in a less touristy area of town - it has dorms and is half the price of my current place. This is more what I had in mind! I meet some travellers, local 20 somethings staying at the hostel for an extended period of time while working in the city and even exchange students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/W0UR1bMe8-ZLkFsz7VZmRNY6tAqxX6E9UGLO_jZkEF1iw6SM33NP5lXY_T0nYZN6fGd8iv4s-47QoYteOTAeangOehU9O5-2NSVOD0Po6e7rZPZlBIJ26DxiUQcfUVBN0J7l5V_Y86o" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my new surroundings, I am more motivated to go explore and end up making some cool friends - I eventually stayed with one of those guys in Mumbai (where he is originally from) as I arrived in the city and couldn’t find any hostels (I was later told that there are no hostels in Mumbai…). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I get sick… Terrible fever for one week that has me bed-ridden. It got so bad that I started to think I had contracted dengue fever and booked an appointment with the doctor. All sorts of thoughts went through my head and I even started imaging a return home after two weeks of a yearlong backpacking trip! Thankfully, a few days before the appointment, I start feeling much better and decide that my time in New Delhi is up! It’s a tough place for anyone but I returned to the city later one in my trip and it really grew on me. So I buy a train ticket to Rishikesh and leave the next day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick side note about purchasing train tickets since I had a few people there warn me about that! When you go to the New Delhi train station, there is an International Tourist Bureau where the staff is dedicated to helping tourist get around the country by train - they are friendly, speak English very well and understand the needs of foreigners wanting to explore their homeland. They don’t charge any premium for this service, which is quite incredible but also detrimental to other travel agencies and whatever other business that sells train tickets to tourists. Some of these business owners are so desperate that they send out their employees to the train station where they tell any tourists in sight that the tourist bureau is closed because of a flood or fire, or that they have relocated to another part of town and that they can help them find a cheap way to get you to your destination. Do not believe a word! The bureau is open 24/7, at least back in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took an overnight train to a small city in northern India called Rishikesh (if you don't know it, google it! It's breathtaking) and felt like my adventure was finally starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mnwuS3D7K4GDGx5dLaRCnFQhPrbMFJc0qF4xpJTt9XWSsJQOts_rNOCdP_wJIECNGxzHV2hRNcdKyZp1d7P2J0QPeILmGrOeVG6xw9TKAGVkXu3zdCAxpCw-QT2VIMxS9wc7oxlrXQI" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bid goodbye to my new friends thinking I would never see them again, although this turned out not to be true. During my first ever train ride in India (followed by many, many more) I met locals on the train who fed me traditional food from their state and made me feel so welcomed, something that I had yet to experience. During my time in this beautiful mountain town, I rented a scooter to explore the mountains, swam in a holy river, went rafting and met some really amazing people (link to Rishikesh photos here). I also attended a massive and famous prayer ceremony that is well known across India and it was one of the most powerful experiences I've had. It is really worth the time - I later found out that there is another prayer that is even bigger in Haridwar, which is 10 minutes form Rishikesh! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my time in Rishikesh, I didn't look back. I had also realized that the big Indian cities were not made for me and for many other travellers I've met. To experience the beauty that is India, I decided that I would spend most of my time in small town and villages and that is one of the best decisions I've made. I stayed in Rishikesh for one week then moved north to a town in the Himalayas called Dharamsala (the home of the Dalai Lama) and to a city near the border with Pakistan, called Amritsar. While in those places, I did an overnight hike to a hilltop and slept under a starry sky, volunteered with an organization to help clean up some hiking trails in the mountains, hiked to a waterfall, slept in a golden temple for three days, watched a ceremony between the Indian and Pakistani army at the border and so many more things! (link to Dharamsala and Amritsar pictures).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jloXr_jG0EN8-z6bvidlwk0xECBuhuSjHz_UJSJMTgSiSXZmKgaYaUtU-UTV3ca-Ay4o6IL_i_67kFUzz8wAnqHb3Zi1KQQB-p1AWYxm1VvXTYp9IwBY8TH0vUr3Rn0qawBiLg2t3T4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was really experiencing India at this point. From Amritsar, I took a 14 hour train ride to a city in the desert called Ajmer. There, I had my first experience with &lt;a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/"&gt;CouchSurfing&lt;/a&gt;. If you are not familiar with it, it is a website where you create a profile and look for people in the cities you plan to visit who offer you a place to sleep in their home, free of charge! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Ajmer helped me experience a different side of India. I stayed with a very kind host, who made me feel very welcome (a recurring theme in this wonderful country full of beautiful people). He was a teacher at arguably the most prestigious boarding school in India and for good reason. He allowed us to stay in his apartment which was provided by the school and was located right on campus. The school was established during the British rule and served as the primary centre of education for all children of British officials. Its stunning infrastructure brought me back to a time where Indians didn't have much and were in many ways prosecuted and made to feel like outcasts in their own land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own ancestors fled this oppression in search of better oppprtunities a long time ago. Being in this environment, even for a short period of time, helped me understand (ever so slightly) the hardship that this country and its people went through. I also had the opportunity to watch the National Youth Yoga Championship of India on a Saturday afternoon which is something that will stay with me for a long time. I actually was quite upset afterwards but this is not the right place to vent these frustrations (I’ll table it and maybe will post something later on). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidding goodbye to Ajmer, I change my plans at the mention of Pushkar, a beautiful city located 30 minutes by bus from Ajmer. The buses run quite frequently and once there, I find a fairly cheap hostel and decide to bunk there for a couple of days while I figure out what this town has to offer. It is a very holy place, full of beautiful and famous temples, and one of the few places in India dedicated to one of the gods on the Hindu holy trinity - most other places are dedicated to the other two deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gJPfYxIjfCrGJFBg7wJSmd-9xrYLcC8LpVrxVbm9EJkyqm5vUjuuzLigiajfwNW-vLb80DVleZ5C-VpT6ipqN0USvReK5U4g_uOksEQVqeqC-mM2a8ss4kX3IrE9OksWEem8YsKOgOg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Pushkar was marked by tranquility and peace of mind, although I had moments feeling quite the opposite! I had my first experience with scammers who took advantage of my renewed interest in the Hindu religion to try to extort 2000 rupees from me. Thankfully I didn't fall for it and only lost 100 rupees in the ordeal but it had me feel upset at the lengths people will go to make some money from tourists. Aside from that incident, Pushkar is a stunning town, full of history and beautiful temples that are reminiscent of a time long gone. I was told of a world famous festival that takes place there and attracts a lot of people from the world over. After Pushkar, I moved back to Jaipur which I passed through very briefly in my way to Ajmer. I bunked with a lovely Muslim family I had met through CouchSurfing for a couple of days in the heart of the city. They are some of the kindest people I have ever met, who run a small gem stone shop (a staple of Jaipur) but still find the time to welcome tourists even though to their city!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchase a train ticket to Mumbai. There I am meeting my uncle, who is in the city for business. He was staying at a fancy hotel near the airport and he offered me the opportunity to stay with him for a few days and attend an engagement party. The experience was amazing although drastically different from my travels so far - the bathroom in our hotel room was bigger than my room in Jaipur! I got to witness to different sides of India and I’m grateful for that chance. After a weekend filled with booze and cigarettes, I bid my uncle goodbye and head to Pune for a few days. I managed to get a CouchSurfing host who offered me a room in his place indefinitely! Being on a tight budget, I thought that this would be a perfect opportunity to stay put and organize the next few weeks of my adventure. I do just that, spending a lot of days in the apartment doing some research on my next move. I went to explore Pune for one day although the apartment where I was staying was quite far from the city centre. Pune was not too exciting for a backpacker, although I might not have known all the good spots!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="travel"></category><category term="India"></category></entry></feed>

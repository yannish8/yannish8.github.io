    <p>How to write about a journey like this? I pondered this many times during my trip, forcing myself to sit down and write by hand all the experiences I had. I tried to do this many times on my adventure and it always felt like a chore. When my journal containing all these stories was stolen, along with many other and more valuable things (more on that later), I thought that the time will come to let these thoughts flow but that I should enjoy this trip and not worry about forgetting each moment.</p>
<p>I started this “journal” on the one year anniversary of my departure and I feel like I cannot remember all the things I have experienced and learnt in the last year and it scares me. I dove right back into daily life upon my return and it feels like a life time has passed since I decided to leave. So, here I am, willing and motivated to put on “paper” all the incredible things that happened on my journey.</p>
<h2>How I Stayed Alive</h2>
<p>If you are wondering why I refer to "staying alive", it has to do with a song I listened to quite often before doing this trip. No, it's not Staying Alive by the Bee Gees (although I cannot blame you if that was your guess) but rather this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucJk8TxyRg">one</a>.</p>
<p>Last September, I quit my job and decided to travel, starting off in India and making my way by land (as much as possible) through Asia over the course of ten months. I spent 5 incredible months in India which I can easily say was the best time of my life.</p>
<h3>Arrival in New Delhi</h3>
<p>Let's start from the beginning, shall we - I flew from Toronto to New Delhi on a gruelling flight that took me through Chicago and Helsinki over three days. In the spirit of this adventure, I had decided that when I landed, I would jump right in the metro and make my way to the hostel using directions from Google Maps that I had written in my journal. Terrible idea.</p>
<p>Once I got out of the airport, I was hit by what can only be described as an unbearable (in hindsight, this is an exaggeration but at the time, I did not think I would make it through it) stench, along with a smog so thick you can barely see across the road - there's really nothing like it. Easily enough, I find the entrance to the subway and hop right along to my destination: the New Delhi Railway Station. If you don't know, the railway station is located in the heart of the city and is one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi_railway_station">largest and biggest in India</a>. It is quite difficult to put into words the scene that I witnessed upon arrival but, in my humble opinion, it is what best describes India - something that you cannot believe at first, end up loathing after you have been in it for a while and miss sorely once you are no longer there. While I look like I belong in India (I am of Indian origins), my backpack gives me away as a tourist and I am quickly surrounded by rickshaws trying to get me to hire their service. According to Google, I should be able to walk from the railway station to my hostel but if you witness the clusterf*ck that I was in, you would understand that there was no way to get out of it unless you had been living there for some time. So I hire a rickshaw, pay about 5 times ($2 CAD…steep!) the normal price and get dropped off in a street that looks like the entrance to a dump site. There are no street signs or names and it's nearly impossible to tell where one street ends and another begins. Thankfully, I had remembered some of the instruction on the hostel website about their location and asked some locals who sent me in the right direction. After walking for about 5 minutes, I see a landmark mentioned on the website (a Citibank ATM) and think I must be close... However, their is a foul-smelling urinal located right at the entrance of the alley where I would be living for the next three days. I think  to myself "I must be in the wrong place" and walk on to look for another “more normal” street but to no avail. So I muster up whatever courage I have remaining, and walk, nose clenched, into this alley. Lo and behold, after a restaurant located right across from the urinal, a small convenience store and a sketchy looking hotel, I see my hostel! I could not believe I had made my way through all of that confusion to find my way there and this was my very first day in the country!</p>
<h3>My first taste of India and travel life</h3>
<p>The hostel I am in isn’t really suited to my travel style. It’s fairly cheap (about $20 a night) - however, when compared to all other accommodations I discovered during my trip, this price was outrageous! To be fair, I was afforded a private room with bathroom and AC but it was difficult to meet other travellers in this setting. I spent the next three days on a weird sleep schedule because of the jet lag but most importantly because I could not find it in me to venture outside in the unbearable heat in Paharganj (this room did have AC after all). For those that don't know, Paharganj is a famous neighbourhood of New Delhi where a lot of cheap hostels and hence, backpackers, are located. It is full of shops and restaurants and is too chaotic for someone that just spent 3 days flying from the other side of the world. </p>
<p>Having had enough of this lonely experience and fully recovered from my jet lag, I pack up and move to another hostel in a less touristy area of town - it has dorms and is half the price of my current place. This is more what I had in mind! I meet some travellers, local 20 somethings staying at the hostel for an extended period of time while working in the city and even exchange students. With my new surroundings, I am more motivated to go explore and end up making some cool friends - I eventually stayed with one of those guys in Mumbai (where he is originally from) as I arrived in the city and couldn’t find any hostels (I was later told that there are no hostels in Mumbai…). Then I get sick… Terrible fever for one week that has me bed-ridden. It got so bad that I started to think I had contracted dengue fever and booked an appointment with the doctor. All sorts of thoughts went through my head and I even started imaging a return home after two weeks of a yearlong backpacking trip! Thankfully, a few days before the appointment, I start feeling much better and decide that my time in New Delhi is up! It’s a tough place for anyone but I returned to the city later one in my trip and it really grew on me. So I buy a train ticket to Rishikesh and leave the next day!</p>
<hr>
<p>Quick side note about purchasing train tickets since I had a few people there warn me about that! When you go to the New Delhi train station, there is an International Tourist Bureau where the staff is dedicated to helping tourist get around the country by train - they are friendly, speak English very well and understand the needs of foreigners wanting to explore their homeland. They don’t charge any premium for this service, which is quite incredible but also detrimental to other travel agencies and whatever other business that sells train tickets to tourists. Some of these business owners are so desperate that they send out their employees to the train station where they tell any tourists in sight that the tourist bureau is closed because of a flood or fire, or that they have relocated to another part of town and that they can help them find a cheap way to get you to your destination. Do not believe a word! The bureau is open 24/7 (confirm this information).</p>
<p>I took an overnight train to a small city in northern India called Rishikesh (if you don't know it, google it! It's breathtaking) and felt like my adventure was finally starting. I bid goodbye to my new friends thinking I would never see them again, although this turned out not to be true. During my first ever train ride in India (followed by many, many more) I met locals on the train who fed me traditional food from their state and made me feel so welcomed, something that I had yet to experience. During my time in this beautiful mountain town, I rented a scooter to explore the mountains, swam in a holy river, went rafting and met some really amazing people (link to Rishikesh photos here). I also attended a massive and famous prayer ceremony that is well known across India and it was one of the most powerful experiences I've had. It is really worth the time - I later found out that there is another prayer that is even bigger in Haridwar, which is 10 minutes form Rishikesh! </p>
<p>After my time in Rishikesh, I didn't look back. I've also realized that the big Indian cities were not made for me and for many other travellers I've met. To experience the beauty that is India, I decided that I would spend most of my time in small town and villages and that is one of the best decisions I've made. I stayed one week in Rishikesh then moved north to a town in the Himalayas called Dharamsala (the home of the Dalai Lama) and to a city near the border with Pakistan, called Amritsar. While in those places, I did an overnight hike to a hilltop and slept under a starry sky, volunteered with an organization to help clean up some hiking trails in the mountains, hiked to a waterfall, slept in a golden temple for three days, watched a ceremony between the Indian and Pakistani army at the border and so many more things! (link to Dharamsala and Amritsar pictures). </p>
<p>During my there, I aIso met a girl… We hit it off while hiking in Dharamsala and decided to travel together for a while since we were thinking about going to the same places. It started out really well but we eventually got under each other’s skin, which tends to happen when you travel with someone you’ve just met. We spent the majority of our days together when we didn’t really know each other and eventually found out that we were not really compatible. This was a sentiment reciprocated by many people I met on the road who originally hit it off with a fellow traveller to eventually split up on not-so-great terms… Reflecting on these scenarios later on in my trip, I realized that this was much more common for solo travellers. They sought each other out and were more likely to pair up with another solo traveller - I met some wonderful people that way but also encountered others that I was not very compatible with. </p>
<p>Aside from the personal encounters, I felt like I was really experiencing India at this point. From Amritsar, I took a 14 hour train ride to a city in the desert called Ajmer. There, I had my first experience with CouchSurfing. If you are not familiar with it, it is a website where you create a profile and look for people in the cities you plan to be who offer you a place to sleep in their home, free of charge! (insert link to couchsurfing here!) My time in Ajmer helped me experience a different side of India. I stayed with a very kind host, who made me feel very welcome (a recurring theme in this wonderful country full of beautiful people). He was a teacher at arguably the most prestigious boarding school in India and for good reason. He allowed us to stay in his apartment which was provided by the school and was located right on campus. The school was established during the British rule (insert link to provide details here using HTML) and served as the primary centre of education for all children of British officials. Its stunning infrastructure brought me to a time where Indians didn't have much and were in many ways prosecuted and made to feel like outcasts in their own land (insert link here to india's history with England). My own ancestors fled this oppression in search of better oppprtunities a long time ago (insert link here to indentured labourers history in Mauritius). Being in this environment, even for a short period of time, helped me understand (ever so slightly) the hardship that this country and its people went through. I also had the opportunity to watch the National Youth Yoga Championship of India on a Saturday afternoon which is something that will stay with me for a long time. I actually was quite upset afterwards but this is not the right place to vent these frustrations (I’ll table it and maybe will post something later on). </p>
<p>Bidding goodbye to Ajmer, I change my plans at the mention of Pushkar, a beautiful city located 30 minutes by bus from Ajmer. The buses run quite frequently and once there, I find a fairly cheap hostel and decide to bunk there for a couple of days while I figure out what this town has to offer. It is a very holy place, full of beautiful and famous temples, and one of the few places in India dedicated to one of the gods on the Hindu holy trinity (include link to Brahman here using HTML) - most other places are dedicated to the other two deities.</p>
<p>My time in Pushkar was marked by tranquility and peace of mind, although I had moments feeling quite the opposite! I had my first experience with scammers who took advantage of my renewed interest in the Hindu religion to try to extort 2000 - 3000 rupees from me. Thankfully I didn't fall for it and only lost 100 rupees in the ordeal but it had me feeling upset at the lengths people will go to make some money from tourists. Aside from that incident, Pushkar is a stunning town, full of history and beautiful temples that are reminiscent of a time long gone. I was told of a world famous festival that takes place there's and attracts a lot of people from the world over (insert link to Pushkar camel festival using HTML). After Pushkar, I moved back to Jaipur which I passed through very briefly in my way to Ajmer. I bunked with a lovely Muslim family I had met through CouchSurfing for a couple of days in the heart of the city. They are some of the kindest people I have ever met, who run a small gem stone shop (a staple of Jaipur) but still find the time to welcome tourists even though they're </p>
<hr>
<p>After returning to Jaipur and spending some time with a wonderful local family, I purchase a train ticket to Mumbai. There I am meeting my uncle, who’s in the city for business. He was staying at a fancy hotel near the airport and he offered me the opportunity to stay with him for a few days and attend an engagement party. The experience was amazing although drastically different from my travels so far - the bathroom in our hotel room was bigger than my room in Jaipur! I got to witness to different sides of India and I’m grateful for that chance. After a weekend filled with booze and cigarettes, I bid my uncle goodbye and head to Pune for a few days. I managed to get a CouchSurfing host who offered me a room in his place indefinitely! Being on a tight budget, I thought that this would be a perfect opportunity to stay put and organize the next few weeks on my adventure. I do just that, spending a lot of days in the apartment doing some research on my next move. I went to explore Pune for one day although the apartment where I was staying was quite far from the city centre. Pune was not too exciting for a backpacker, although I might not have known all the good spots! However, there is one anecdote from my day in the city that is worth sharing. I took a bus in and got dropped off in the centre of the city. From there, I really had no idea where to go, which is my preferred way of discovering a new place. I have my backpack on and it’s pretty clear to everyone around me that I’m not from here. While in India, I realized that having Indian origins was a huge bonus for me: people didn’t harass me as much as my non-Indian friends, I could get better deals on food and accommodation, and people just stared less. Yet, part of me longed for that attention that almost everyone else that I was travelling with was receiving. So, on that fateful day in Pune, while I’m walking and trying to find out where to go, I am approached by a local on a motorcycle who inquires about my destination - finally I'm intriguing enough for someone to approach me! I tell him that I’m trying to find somewhere nice to see in Pune, and we start chatting for a bit. His English is not great but we manage to understand one another. Then he tells me he likes me... I thank him for that nice comment and tell him I like him too, in a very innocent kind of way. Then he tells me his gay. And I respond  with a nod. And then, he tells me he wants to give me oral sex. I pause for a moment thinking about how to best handle this awkward proposition and finally decide that the best move is to just turn around and walk away… I then turn around to see if he’s following me - thankfully he is not. Instead he’s on his phone, checking his messages - perhaps telling his friend that yet another move failed!</p>
<p>Having proofread the above, it definitely sounded funnier in my head - but I still would like to share this story with you. After spending some time in Pune organizing my next moves and meeting up with my cousin (which was lovely!), I secured a HelpX opportunity. For the uninitiated, <a href="http://helpx.org/">HelpX.org</a> (create website link with HTML) is a website similar to "work away" (create Website link with HTML) where people advertise volunteer opportunities for their business, farm or home (sometimes all three rolled into one). In exchange for the help, they provide room or board or both. It's a nice opportunity for travellers with limited funds to discover a new place while helping someone! I wanted to try something through this organization as I started to grow disillusioned with the large cities and the popular tourist destinations - I felt that I was not getting the cultural exchange that I was seeking and thought that some time in a remote area of India doing work </p>
